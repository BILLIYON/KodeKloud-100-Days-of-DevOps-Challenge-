# üöÄ 100 Days of DevOps Challenge  

This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of DevOps Challenge (KodeKloud)**.  
Each day, I‚Äôll log the task, solution, and key takeaways as I learn and practice DevOps concepts and tools.

## üìÖ Progress Log  

---

### ‚úÖ Day 1 ‚Äì Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell  
**Task:**  
Create a user named `james` with a non-interactive shell on App Server 3 to accommodate a backup agent tool.  

**Solution:**  
```bash
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin james
grep james /etc/passwd
````

**Takeaway:**
Non-interactive shells like `/sbin/nologin` or `/bin/false` prevent direct logins but allow services/processes to run securely under the user.

---

### ‚úÖ Day 2 ‚Äì Linux Temporary User with Expiry
**Task:**  
Today‚Äôs challenge in the 100 Days of DevOps was about user lifecycle management. 
I created a developer account (siva) with a predefined expiry date to ensure temporary access for project needs.

**Solution:**  
```bash:
sudo useradd -e 2024-03-28 siva
sudo chage -l siva
````

**Takeaway:**
Setting expiry dates on user accounts is a best practice in DevOps and system administration. It helps enforce principle of least privilege, reduces risks from forgotten accounts, and ensures smooth offboarding for temporary team members.

### ‚úÖ Day 3 ‚Äì Disable Direct SSH Root Login
**Task:**  
Following security audits at xFusionCorp Industries, the security team required disabling direct SSH root login on all app servers in the Stratos Datacenter.

**Solution:**  
- SSH‚Äôd into each app server (`stapp01`, `stapp02`, `stapp03`).
- Edited `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  - Set `PermitRootLogin no`.
- Restarted `sshd` service to apply changes.
- Verified that direct root login was disabled, while normal users retained sudo access

**Takeaway:**
Direct root SSH access is a critical security risk. By disabling it, we enforce the principle of least privilege‚Äîensuring admins log in as regular users first, and only escalate when necessary.

### ‚úÖ Day 4 ‚Äì Script Execution Permissions
**Task:**  
A backup automation script (`xfusioncorp.sh`) had been distributed but wasn‚Äôt properly executable.

**Solution:**  
I used Linux file permissions (`chmod`) to ensure all users could run the script while keeping ownership intact.

**Key Commands:**
```bash
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh   # check current permissions
chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh   # set proper executable rights
```
Permission after fix: -rwxr-xr-x 1

**Takeaway:**
Permissions are a critical part of Linux security.
Scripts often need to be readable and executable across users, but not always writable.
This was a small but essential step in automating and securing infrastructure.

### ‚úÖ Day 5 - SElinux Installation and Configuration

**Task:**
Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team decided to strengthen server security with **SELinux**. For App Server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter, I was asked to:

* Install the required SELinux packages.
* Permanently disable SELinux (until further configuration is ready).
* Ensure no reboot is performed immediately (changes should take effect after scheduled maintenance).

**Solution:**

1. **Install SELinux packages**

```bash
# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y selinux-basics selinux-policy-default auditd
```

2. **Edit SELinux config**

```bash
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
```

Change:

```
SELINUX=enforcing
```

to:

```
SELINUX=disabled
```

3. **Verify changes**

```bash
grep SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config
# Output:
SELINUX=disabled
```

No reboot required now. After the scheduled reboot, SELinux will be permanently disabled. ‚úÖ

**Takeaway:**

* SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) enforces fine-grained access control, but sometimes needs to be temporarily disabled for system/application compatibility.
* Understanding how to configure SELinux is critical in system hardening and troubleshooting.
* Security is a balance: sometimes you prepare the environment first (packages installed) before enabling strict policies.

### ‚è≥ Day 6 ‚Äì \[Task Title Here]

**Task:**
*Description of the task goes here.*

**Solution:**

```bash
# commands or configuration used
```

**Takeaway:**
*Short reflection or lesson learned.*
